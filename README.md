# BANG
crappy attempt to recreate the great Bang Bead with Phaser

#TODO
phew...quite a lot

- all the graphics
- all the sounds
- all the animations
- GUI
- game states
- modularize code
- most of the game logic
- special moves, slides, and even the powershot
- gamepad support

so probably this will never reach any kind of playable state :-)
